Has been used for vaccine development [PubMed: 10816475][PubMed: 11953393][PubMed: 12933826].    

MUTATION: An isogenic sodC mutant constructed from B abortus 2308 by gene replacement exhibited much greater susceptibility to killing by exogenous O(2)(-) than the parental 2308 strain, supporting a role for SodC in protecting this bacterium from O(2)(-) stress. The B abortus sodC mutant was much more sensitive to killing by cultured resident peritoneal macrophages from C57BL6J mice than 2308, and its attenuation in cultured murine macrophages was enhanced when these phagocytes were treated with gamma interferon. The attenuation of the B abortus sodC mutant in both resting and IFN-gamma-activated macrophages was alleviated in the presence of the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin. Consistently, the B abortus sodC mutant also displayed significant attenuation in infected C57BL6J mice compared to the parental strain. These findings suggest that SodC protects B abortus 2308 from the respiratory burst of host macrophages [PubMed: 15845493].",

Mice immunized with fusion Rop2-83 elicited a stronger humoral and cellular response in comparison to mice immunized with Rop2 alone, or a mix of LiHsp83 and Rop2. The fusion protein induced a Th1 type response, with predominance of specific IgG2a/IgG2c isotype and IFN-gamma secretions, whereas Rop2 alone or mixed with LiHsp83 produced a Th1/Th2 mixed response. Vaccination with fusion protein conferred a remarkable resistance against oral infection with ME49 cysts in C57BL/6 and C3H mice, in comparison to mice immunized with Rop2 alone or the protein mixture. Following lethal challenge, a significant survival rate was observed in Rop2-83 immunized Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice in comparison to control groups [PubMed: 16545504].",

Immunized animals were protected against disease when challenged with BCH-3, but not with an ompP1 mutant of BCH-3 or a strain (BCH-2) possessing a heterologous P1 (91% identity). We conclude that (i) while P1 induces protection against NTHI-mediated otitis media, development of a polyvalent vaccine reflecting the variability of P1 would be necessary to construct an efficacious vaccine [PubMed: 10899849].",
