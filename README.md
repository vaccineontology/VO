# VO
Vaccine Ontology

The Vaccine Ontology (VO) is a community-based ontology in the domain of vaccinology. It is developed to ensure consistent representation of vaccine knowledge and to support automated reasoning. This international collaborative VO development effort has been joined by many institutes and disciplines around the world. The Vaccine Ontology is also being used in a variety of applications by many user groups in academia and industry.
